# To Do App

This project is a simple "To Do App" created as part of a Codecademy CSS course. It demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS to build a visually appealing and responsive layout for a weekly task planner.

## Features

- **Header**: Displays the app's title and tagline.
- **Weekly Planner**: A grid layout for organizing tasks for each day of the week (Monday to Friday).
- **Reminders Section**: A dedicated area for reminders.
- **Footer**: Contains a copyright notice.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **[index.html](index.html)**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the app.
- **[style.css](style.css)**: The CSS file that styles the app.

## Key CSS Concepts Used

- **Flexbox**: Used extensively for layout, including the weekly planner grid and reminders section.
- **Custom Fonts**: Integrated Google Fonts (`Quicksand` and `Rock Salt`) for a unique look.
- **Color Scheme**: Utilized colors like `steelblue`, `khaki`, and `snow` for a clean and modern design.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured elements are aligned and spaced properly using flex properties.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the app.
